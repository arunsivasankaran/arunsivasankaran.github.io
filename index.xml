      <description>ASCII Computers can only represent binary values in storage. To represent characters in storage - we map these characters to numbers (decimal) and then we use binary to represent these numbers in computer storage. With enough numbers, we can represent pretty much anything we want - real or made up, in binary. These mappings of characters to numbers are called character encodings, and ASCII is one such encoding.
In ASCII, an A in decimal, is 65 and in binary is 01000001.</description>
